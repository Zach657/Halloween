        <p>
            I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite 
            holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my 
            favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.

            If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite 
            Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email 
            list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
